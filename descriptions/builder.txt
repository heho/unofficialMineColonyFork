Builder
New worker with minecraft .42.
Programmed by rscott6666

The Builder builds buildings and will do some light landscaping.
To build the builder you must place a door in the center
spot and planks on the outside.  The builder will appear next to the chest.
Unlike the other workers, the builders chest does not respond
to the gold sceptre.  The iron sceptre will place fences as usual.
 
The builder waits for you to place a build sign within 30 blocks
of his chest.  The sign must read "Build" on the top line and the
name of the structure to build on the second line.  The following
structures are provided with the mod.  Tower1, SimpleHouse1, SimpleHouse2
SimpleHouse3, Warehouse, BuilderHut, FarmerHut, LumberjackHut,
MinerHut, chalet.
In all cases, it doesn't matter if its upper or lower case.
 

The structures are build from .floorplan files which detail how the
house is built.  The .floorplan files are found
in the resources folder.
 
The builder needs materials to build the house.  If the floorplan
asks for glass, you must give the builder glass.  If the floorplan
calls for uncut wood, you must give the builder uncut wood...
The builder will look for materials in other chests if they are nearby.
If the builder cannot locate the required materials, he will wait
back at his chest with a sign of what he needs.  He will also
let you know how many he will need to finish the job.  For example,
"Out of planks 65".  The builder does not pick resources up that
are next to him, he only gets them from chests.
 
If you remove the sign before the builder is finshed, he will stop
building.
 
The builder will do some crafting for you.  But none that require
the furnace.  So uncut wood -> planks will be performed. 
But sand->glass will not.  Wood->planks->sticks->fencepost will
be performed.
 
After each job, the builder returns the unused materials to his
chest.
